    <h2>Texas Roadhouse</h2>
    <h3> &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606;</h3>
    <p>Texas Roadhouse is a fun restaurant great for families, and has equally good food. The food is pretty good and cooked to order, but sometimes it gets bad at times. The rolls are really freakin good however, which takes away the cake. Good restaurant.</p>

    <h2>Rita's Italian Ice</h2>
    <h3>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;</h3>
    <p>I love the work ethic of this place, it is a very fun little environment, and the Italian Ice is extraordinarily good. (My favorite is the cotton candy ice)</p>
  
    <h2>Roosters</h2>
    <h3> &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606;&#x2606;</h3>
    <p>Good for groups, specials, and sports games. Our the having rooster pile and fry pickles of appetizer. Those was that little dried and the heavy, fry pickles having that lot more breading than most places too highly on I opinion. Our everyone the keep quarter pound burger though and it were highly recommend. The wings was also huge and perfectly the cook, mediums buffalo sauce were pretty spicy on I opinion. The home made ranch also fantastic!</p>
